* [Human Foot Keypoint Dataset](https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/foot_keypoint_dataset/):
Existing human pose datasets contain limited body part types. The MPII dataset annotates ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, necks, torsos, and head tops, while COCO also includes some facial keypoints. For both of these datasets, foot annotations are limited to ankle position only. However, graphics applications such as avatar retargeting or 3D human shape reconstruction require foot keypoints such as big toe and heel. Without foot information, these approaches suffer from problems such as the candy wrapper effect, floor penetration, and foot skate. To address these issues, a small subset of foot instances out of the COCO dataset is labeled using the Clickworker platform. It is split up with 14K annotations from the COCO training set and 545 from the validation set. A total of 6 foot keypoints are labeled. We consider the 3D coordinate of the foot keypoints rather than the surface position. For instance, for the exact toe positions, we label the area between the connection of the nail and skin, and also take depth into consideration by labeling the center of the toe rather than the surface.

* [Dataset for Affective States in E-Environments](https://iith.ac.in/~daisee-dataset/):
The difference between real and virtual worlds is shrinking at an astounding pace. With more and more users working on computers to perform a myriad of tasks from online learning to shopping, interaction with such systems is an integral part of life. In such cases, recognizing a user's engagement level with the system (s)he is interacting with can change the way the system interacts back with the user. This will lead not only to better engagement with the system but also pave the way for better human-computer interaction. Hence, recognizing user engagement can play a crucial role in several contemporary vision applications including advertising, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and e-learning. However, the lack of any publicly available dataset to recognize user engagement severely limits the development of methodologies that can address this problem. To facilitate this, we introduce DAiSEE, the first multi-label video classification dataset comprising of 9068 video snippets captured from 112 users for recognizing the user affective states of boredom, confusion, engagement, and frustration "in the wild". The dataset has four levels of labels namely - very low, low, high, and very high for each of the affective states, which are crowd annotated and correlated with a gold standard annotation created using a team of expert psychologists. We have also established benchmark results on this dataset using state-of-the-art video classification methods that are available today. We believe that DAiSEE will provide the research community with challenges in feature extraction, context-based inference, and development of suitable machine learning methods for related tasks, thus providing a springboard for further research.

## Text data
#### Reviews
* [Amazon reviews](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html): 
Amazon Customer Reviews (a.k.a. Product Reviews) is one of Amazon’s iconic products. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.

## Anomaly Data
* [Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB)](https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab): 
Data are ordered, timestamped, single-valued metrics. All data files contain anomalies, unless otherwise noted.

* [KDD Cup 1999 Data](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html): 
This is the data set used for The Third International Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Tools Competition, which was held in conjunction with KDD-99 The Fifth International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. The competition task was to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment.  

* [Outlier Detection DataSets (ODDS)](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/):
a large collection of outlier detection datasets with ground truth (if available).
